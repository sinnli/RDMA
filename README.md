# RDMA
RDMA stands for Remote Direct Memory Access, and it's a technology that allows data to be transferred between two devices 
in a network without involving the CPUs of the devices for data movement.
This enables low-latency, high-bandwidth, and efficient data transfers, making it 
particularly useful in high-performance computing (HPC) and data-intensive applications.
